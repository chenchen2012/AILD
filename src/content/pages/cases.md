cards:
  - tag: B2B services leadership team | 42 managers
    title: Executive reporting decision redesign
    text: Baseline was 6.1 hours/week per manager for KPI narrative prep and reconciliation. After introducing AI decision briefs and final human sign-off, cycle time dropped to 1.9 hours/week and follow-up clarification requests fell 27 percent.
    result: "-69% KPI prep time | -27% clarification churn"
  - tag: SMB commerce leadership team | 16 decision owners
    title: Campaign prioritization and launch governance
    text: Baseline campaign setup was 9.4 days from idea to approved launch package. With AI-assisted scenario comparison and trust-vs-override checkpoints, median launch prep dropped to 5.8 days and brand-compliance pass rate improved from 74 percent to 93 percent.
    result: "-38% launch prep time | +19pt compliance pass rate"
  - tag: SaaS support management | 28 leads and specialists
    title: Triage policy and escalation decision system
    text: Before intervention, median first response was 11.6 hours with high variance. After introducing tiered decision rules and QA gates, median first response moved to 8.9 hours and avoidable escalations dropped 21 percent.
    result: "-23% first-response time | -21% avoidable escalations"
  - tag: Multi-site education operations | 19 administrators
    title: Policy-aligned knowledge refresh operating model
    text: Team reduced article update cycle time by 41 percent while increasing policy-consistent checks from ad hoc review to 100 percent pre-publish verification.
    result: "-41% update cycle | 100% pre-publish policy checks"
  - tag: Regional retail headquarters | 11 functional leaders
    title: Weekly AI-augmented executive workflow
    text: Leadership team moved from fragmented updates to a weekly AI-brief and action board process, reducing decision-to-action delay by 33 percent across cross-functional initiatives.
    result: "-33% decision-to-action delay"
  - tag: Healthcare provider operations | 24 managers
    title: Clinical operations escalation governance
    text: Escalation approvals were inconsistent across sites. After introducing an AI-assisted triage protocol with mandatory human override for high-risk cases, approval cycle time improved 29 percent and policy deviations decreased 38 percent.
    result: "-29% approval cycle | -38% policy deviations"
  - tag: Global procurement leadership | 14 category leaders
    title: Supplier risk review decision protocol
    text: Procurement reviews were delayed by fragmented data collection. With AI-generated risk briefs and a standardized decision memo format, review lead time dropped from 12.3 days to 7.6 days, with improved audit traceability.
    result: "-38% review lead time | audit traceability improved"
sections:
  - heading: Why these cases are credible
    bullets:
      - Every case uses a baseline period before AI workflow changes.
      - Metrics are tracked at weekly cadence, not one-time snapshots.
      - Teams apply trust controls and human accountability, not raw auto-generation.
      - Reported gains are tied to defined decision streams and owners.
  - heading: How AILD measures outcomes
    bullets:
      - Decision cycle time reduction
      - Quality pass rate before execution
      - Action completion and owner accountability
      - Rework and avoidable error reduction
      - Adoption depth by leadership layer
  - heading: Benchmark ranges observed in cases
    bullets:
      - "Decision cycle-time reduction: 20-40 percent"
      - "Clarification and follow-up churn reduction: 15-30 percent"
      - "Policy adherence improvement: 15-35 percent"
      - "Rework reduction in leadership workflows: 20-45 percent"
      - "Cross-functional action completion lift: 10-25 percent"
  - heading: 30-day case build methodology

      - "Days 21-30: measure outcomes and calibrate expansion decision"
  - heading: Measurement boundaries
    text: These metrics are implementation outcomes from scoped workflows, not universal claims. Validate in your own operating context before scaling.
