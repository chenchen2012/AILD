## What cognitive augmentation means

AI should not replace strategic thinking. It should expand leaders' capacity to process complexity and compare alternatives.

## Four augmentation jobs

1. Compression: summarize high-volume signals into concise decision briefs.
2. Contrast: compare options with explicit tradeoffs.
3. Stress-test: challenge assumptions and expose weak logic.
4. Recall: maintain institutional memory across decisions.

## Executive thinking stack

- Morning: signal scan and risk summary
- Midday: option framing and scenario testing
- Weekly: decision retrospective and calibration

## Guardrails

- require source-backed synthesis
- require confidence labeling
- require explicit uncertainty notes

## Anti-patterns

- using AI summaries as unquestioned truth
- skipping assumption challenge step
- no retrospective loop
