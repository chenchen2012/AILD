## Why use retrieval workflows

When teams rely only on model memory, factual drift rises. Retrieval workflows anchor outputs to approved internal sources.

## Business-friendly RAG pattern

- Step 1: collect trusted source docs
- Step 2: structure docs by topic
- Step 3: prompt model to answer only using retrieved material
- Step 4: require source citation in output

## When to use

- policy explanations
- support knowledge base responses
- internal process Q&A

## Reliability rule

No source cited, no approval.
