## Daily executive flow

1. Morning briefing: KPI shifts, anomalies, top risks.
2. Midday prioritization: option comparison and tradeoff review.
3. End-of-day closure: decision log, delegated actions, unresolved risks.

## Weekly executive flow

- Monday: strategic signal review
- Wednesday: cross-functional decision sync
- Friday: outcome check and next-week focus

## Role model

- Executive: final decision and accountability
- Chief of staff: synthesis and decision prep
- Functional leads: evidence inputs and execution updates

## Tooling requirements

- integrated dashboard access
- structured decision memo template
- searchable decision archive

## Failure prevention checklist

- no decision without owner
- no owner without deadline
- no deadline without review checkpoint
