## Core principle

Translate privacy rules into workflow actions, not generic policy statements.

## Required controls

- data classification in place
- restricted data blocked from public tools
- approved tool list enforced
- human review for high-risk outputs
- monthly random sampling audits

## Workflow-level control template

For each workflow define:

- allowed input data
- prohibited input data
- review owner
- escalation path

## Audit checks

Sample output sets monthly and verify:

- no prohibited data used
- review was completed
- incidents logged where needed
