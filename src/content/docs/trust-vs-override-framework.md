## Core principle

Trust is conditional, not binary. The right question is not "AI or human". The right question is "under what conditions do we rely, review, or override?"

## Trust tiers

- Tier 1 (auto-trust with spot checks): low-risk, reversible decisions
- Tier 2 (review-required): medium-risk decisions with business impact
- Tier 3 (mandatory override authority): high-risk decisions affecting legal, financial, or reputational exposure

## Override triggers

- weak evidence quality
- obvious data freshness mismatch
- high-confidence answer with low explainability
- recommendation conflicts with known policy constraints

## Decision log format

For each override record:

- AI recommendation
- reason for override
- final human decision
- expected outcome
- outcome review date

## Executive rule

If consequence severity is high, human accountability remains non-delegable.
