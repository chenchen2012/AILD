## The prioritization problem

Most organizations have more AI ideas than leadership bandwidth. Without a portfolio method, teams over-invest in visible demos instead of strategic advantage.

## 3-axis scoring model

1. Strategic value: expected impact on revenue, margin, or speed.
2. Execution feasibility: data quality, owner readiness, and workflow fit.
3. Governance risk: legal, privacy, reputational, and control complexity.

## Decision rules

- Scale now: high value, high feasibility, manageable risk.
- Pilot with controls: high value but medium feasibility or risk.
- Defer: low value regardless of technical excitement.

## Quarterly cadence

- Review top 10 initiatives each quarter.
- Re-score based on latest evidence.
- Retire projects without measurable movement.
