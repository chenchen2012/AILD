## Purpose

Policy is not a document exercise. It is operating infrastructure for safe scale.

## Section 1: Data classes

- Public: allowed in approved tools
- Internal: use only in controlled environments
- Restricted: never entered into external AI tools

## Section 2: Tool governance

- maintain approved-tool registry
- define approval owner for new tools
- disallow shadow tooling in production workflows

## Section 3: Human review rules

Mandatory review before release for:

- customer-facing outputs
- executive reporting
- finance/compliance-related content

## Section 4: Incident protocol

1. Pause workflow variant with risk signal.
2. Record issue type, impact, and root cause.
3. Apply remediation and communicate changes.
4. Update policy and templates to prevent recurrence.

## Operational cadence

- monthly policy audit
- quarterly policy refresh
- team training after each major update
