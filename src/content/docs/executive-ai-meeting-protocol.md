## Protocol objective

Use AI to improve decision preparation, not to replace meeting ownership.

## Recommended agenda (45-60 min)

1. Signal scan (10 min): AI summary of critical changes and anomalies.
2. Decision focus (20 min): review 1-3 high-impact decisions only.
3. Action conversion (10 min): assign owner, timeline, and success metric.
4. Calibration (5 min): note overrides, assumptions, and follow-up checks.

## Ground rules

- No decision without an explicit owner.
- No AI recommendation accepted without risk review.
- No meeting ends without action tracking.

## Weekly artifact

Publish one decision memo and one action board after each meeting.
