## Dashboard objective

Measure business impact, not AI activity.

## Core metrics

1. Workflow adoption rate
2. Hours saved per user
3. Quality pass rate
4. Rework/error trend
5. Policy incident count

## Reporting template

For each workflow report:

- baseline
- intervention
- outcome
- next decision

## Decision thresholds

- quality falls below target -> pause scaling
- incidents rise -> tighten controls
- savings plateau -> redesign workflow/model/tool mix

## Governance cadence

- weekly function review
- monthly leadership review
- quarterly strategy reset
