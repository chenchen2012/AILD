## What governance lite means

Small and medium teams cannot run enterprise bureaucracy. Governance lite focuses on a minimum control stack that is enforceable.

## Minimum control stack

1. Approved tool registry
2. Data classification rule set
3. Mandatory human QA for high-risk outputs
4. Incident logging and review
5. Monthly governance review meeting

## Owner model

- Executive sponsor: accountability
- Function lead: workflow control
- QA owner: output integrity

## Success signal

Governance works when adoption speed increases while policy violations decrease.
