## Why maturity matters

Many organizations adopt AI tools faster than leadership systems evolve. Maturity framing prevents random adoption and builds a deliberate capability path.

## The 4 stages

1. Tool stage: leaders use AI for isolated tasks.
2. Workflow stage: AI is embedded in repeated leadership routines.
3. Decision stage: AI supports scenario analysis and structured judgment.
4. System stage: governance, cadence, and metrics are integrated across functions.

## Stage diagnostics

- Tool stage signal: high experimentation, low consistency.
- Workflow stage signal: repeated weekly usage with templates.
- Decision stage signal: explicit trust and override rules.
- System stage signal: leadership KPIs tied to business outcomes.

## Upgrading playbook

- Stage 1 to 2: standardize one weekly leadership workflow.
- Stage 2 to 3: implement decision briefs and override logs.
- Stage 3 to 4: run cross-functional review cadence with unified KPIs.
