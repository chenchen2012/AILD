## Why decision intelligence matters

Most organizations adopt AI for task productivity but underuse AI in leadership decisions. The real strategic gain appears when executives redesign decision flow itself.

## The 5-layer stack

1. Problem framing layer: define the decision in precise terms.
2. Evidence layer: gather internal and external signals.
3. Scenario layer: generate multiple strategic options.
4. Judgment layer: apply context, constraints, and accountability.
5. Execution layer: convert decisions into owner-based actions.

## Practical operating model

- AI supports framing and scenario generation.
- Humans own tradeoff judgment and final accountability.
- Review outcomes weekly to calibrate decision quality.

## Implementation checklist

- standardized decision brief template
- explicit evidence quality criteria
- scenario comparison protocol
- override rule for high-risk recommendations
- post-decision review cadence

## Failure patterns

- over-trusting model confidence
- ambiguous decision framing
- no owner for decision follow-through
