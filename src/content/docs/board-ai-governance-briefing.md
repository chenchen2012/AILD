## Why board framing is different

Board decisions focus on exposure, resilience, and strategic return. Operational detail matters only when linked to governance implications.

## Briefing sections

1. Strategic value: where AI creates measurable competitive advantage.
2. Risk landscape: legal, privacy, reputational, and model risk exposure.
3. Control posture: policy coverage, review gates, and override authority.
4. Capability maturity: current leadership maturity stage and gaps.
5. Next-quarter priorities: top 3 governance-backed execution moves.

## Governance signals to track

- percentage of high-risk decisions with documented human approval
- policy adherence rate in AI-assisted workflows
- material incidents and mean time to resolution
- business outcome metrics linked to leadership decisions

## Board-level decision rule

If governance visibility is low but deployment speed is high, pause expansion until control quality catches up.
