## Anti-pattern 1: Tool-first strategy

Leaders start with platforms instead of strategic decisions. Fix by defining priority decisions before selecting tools.

## Anti-pattern 2: Speed without controls

Teams optimize for output velocity but skip risk thresholds. Fix by enforcing trust tiers and override logging.

## Anti-pattern 3: Delegated accountability

AI recommendations are treated as final decisions. Fix by assigning a named human decision owner every time.

## Anti-pattern 4: No calibration loop

Decisions are made but not reviewed. Fix by running weekly and monthly decision quality reviews.

## Anti-pattern 5: Pilot theater

Many pilots, little operational impact. Fix by retiring low-value pilots and scaling only measurable winners.
