## The 5 checks

1. Validity: are claims factually grounded?
2. Completeness: does output answer full task?
3. Tone: does it match channel and audience?
4. Risk: any policy/privacy/compliance conflict?
5. Actionability: can next person execute immediately?

## 5-minute review rhythm

- Minute 1: factual red flags
- Minute 2: structure completeness
- Minute 3: tone and business fit
- Minute 4: risk scan
- Minute 5: pass, revise, or reject

## Pass policy

- at least 4/5 checks pass
- risk check must pass
- failed output must include correction note

## Common mistakes

- treating fluent writing as accurate writing
- skipping risk checks under time pressure
- no explicit reject criteria
