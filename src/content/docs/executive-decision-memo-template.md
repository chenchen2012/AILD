## Memo structure

1. Decision question: what exactly must be decided now.
2. Options: 2-4 viable choices with tradeoffs.
3. Evidence summary: key data, assumptions, and uncertainty.
4. AI recommendation: model-supported option and rationale.
5. Human judgment: final decision with justification.
6. Risk and mitigation: downside scenarios and controls.
7. Owner and timeline: who executes what by when.
8. Review checkpoint: date and metric for outcome validation.

## Quality standard

- concise and decision-focused
- assumptions explicit, not implied
- risk is comparable across options
- ownership and deadline are unambiguous

## Common failure mode

Teams over-document context but under-document accountability. Keep the memo short and execution-specific.
