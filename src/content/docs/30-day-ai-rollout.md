## Goal

Build one reliable AI workflow in 30 days. Do not scale until quality is stable.

## Week 1: Workflow selection and baseline

1. Pick 1-3 high-frequency workflows.
2. Capture baseline metrics: cycle time, rework, clarification loops.
3. Assign roles: workflow owner, QA reviewer, approver.

### Selection criteria

- repeated weekly
- predictable output format
- measurable quality standard
- clear business owner

## Week 2: Standards and risk controls

1. Apply [policy boundaries](/learn/ai-policy-template-smb/).
2. Create prompt templates and output formats.
3. Enforce [5-minute QA checks](/learn/5-minute-ai-quality-check/).

## Week 3: Controlled pilot

1. Run the workflow daily in one team.
2. Log failure patterns and causes.
3. Refine templates based on evidence, not opinions.

## Week 4: Review and scale decision

1. Compare baseline vs pilot metrics.
2. Decide: keep, optimize, or stop.
3. Scale only if quality remains stable.

## Common rollout failures

- tool-first approach without workflow design
- no QA owner
- tracking speed but not quality

## Ready-to-use checklist

- baseline captured
- owner assigned
- QA gate defined
- policy controls active
- weekly review running
