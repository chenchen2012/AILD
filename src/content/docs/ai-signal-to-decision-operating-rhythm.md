## Why rhythm beats ad hoc reaction

AI can surface many signals, but value appears only when leaders convert the right signals into decisions quickly and consistently.

## Weekly rhythm

- Monday: AI signal digest with anomalies and opportunities.
- Tuesday: decision meeting on top-priority items.
- Wednesday/Thursday: execution and risk monitoring.
- Friday: outcome review and next-week adjustment.

## Signal filtering standard

- material business relevance
- evidence confidence above threshold
- clear decision owner
- executable within current constraints

## Failure pattern to avoid

Teams collect insights but delay commitments. A signal has no value until ownership and action are defined.
