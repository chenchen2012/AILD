## Why model selection matters

Model choice affects output quality, cost, speed, and risk. Teams should avoid single-model dependency for all tasks.

## Selection dimensions

- Accuracy needs: factual precision and reasoning depth
- Speed needs: response latency requirements
- Cost limits: budget per user/workflow
- Risk posture: data handling and compliance constraints
- Ecosystem fit: integration with your existing stack

## Task-to-model strategy

- High-risk reporting: prioritize accuracy and controllability
- Draft ideation: optimize cost and speed
- Customer-facing outputs: prioritize consistency and reviewability

## Operating rule

Assign a preferred model per workflow, plus one fallback model for resilience.

## Review cadence

Re-evaluate model fit monthly as providers and pricing evolve.
