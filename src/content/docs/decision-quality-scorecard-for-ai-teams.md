## Why a separate scorecard

Output volume is not decision quality. Teams need a structured way to track whether AI improves judgment and business impact.

## Core dimensions

1. Clarity: was the decision question defined precisely?
2. Evidence quality: were assumptions and data confidence explicit?
3. Risk handling: were major downside scenarios addressed?
4. Execution quality: were ownership and deadlines clear?
5. Outcome alignment: did results match the intended objective?

## Scoring approach

- Score each dimension 1-5.
- Flag any dimension below 3 for corrective action.
- Review trends monthly, not in isolation.

## Leadership practice

Pair this scorecard with weekly review meetings and override logs to calibrate both AI use and human judgment quality.
