## Why run a baseline first

Most AI programs fail because teams skip capability diagnosis. A baseline assessment gives leaders a real starting point for leadership and execution plans.

## Five assessment dimensions

1. Task Fit: Which tasks are repetitive, text-heavy, and reviewable?
2. Data Risk: What data can be used safely in AI tools?
3. Prompt Competence: Can staff generate usable outputs consistently?
4. Review Discipline: Are there clear quality gates before outputs ship?
5. Measurement Readiness: Are baseline time and quality metrics tracked?

## Scoring model

Use a 1-5 scale per dimension.

- 1-2: high risk, low readiness
- 3: partial readiness
- 4-5: strong readiness for scaled rollout

## What to do with low scores

- Low task fit: start with workflow discovery and process mapping.
- Low data risk maturity: deploy policy controls before any expansion.
- Low review discipline: enforce [5-minute QA checks](/learn/5-minute-ai-quality-check/).
- Low measurement readiness: set up the [ROI dashboard](/learn/ai-roi-dashboard-and-metrics/).

## Decision rule

Do not scale across departments until at least three dimensions score 4+ for the pilot function.
